# Step 2: Exploring Alternatives

## Brainstormed Logic-Based Solutions

### Solution 1: Sensor-Based Control
Install a combination of **train detection sensors** and **vehicle detection sensors** (e.g., infrared).  
- When a train approaches, the system automatically lowers the gates.  
- When a vehicle is detected on the tracks, the system keeps the gates lowered until it is safe.  
- The system reopens the gates only after confirming both the train has passed and no vehicles remain on the track.

### Solution 2: Time-Based Control
Use a simple **time-delay mechanism** along with a train sensor.  
- When the sensor detects a train, the gates are lowered.  
- After the train passes, the system waits a fixed amount of time before raising the gates.  
- This ensures vehicles have enough time to clear the crossing, but the method does not adapt to unexpected conditions.

## Real-World Example (100 words)
A sensor-based railway level crossing system has already been implemented in practice (Maheswar, Hemalatha, Surya, Suryanarayana, & Bhargav, 2024). The system uses infrared sensors placed at the entry and exit points of railway tracks to detect trains. When a train is detected, an Arduino-based microcontroller activates the control mechanism to lower the gates. Once the track is confirmed clear and safe, the gates are reopened. This real-time sensor approach increases reliability by adapting to actual conditions rather than relying on fixed timing, reducing human error and the risk of accidents.
