## Overview
Logic-based safety system for a railway level crossing. Gates lower if a train is approaching or a vehicle is on the track, and only raise when safe.

## Repository Structure
- /Step1_Analysis — Restated problem, inputs/outputs, constraints, stakeholders
- /Step2_Alternatives — Two solutions + real-world example
- /Step3_4_Evaluation_Decision — Evaluation and final decision
- /Step5_6_Algorithm_Flowchart — Word-based code + flowchart.png
- /Step7_Testing — Truth table, test cases, refinements
- /Docs — Source documents (Word/PDF)

## How to View
- Flowchart: `/Step5_6_Algorithm_Flowchart/flowchart.png`
- Algorithm: `/Step5_6_Algorithm_Flowchart/word_code.md`
- Test results: `/Step7_Testing/test_plan.md`

## Part 2 Compliance
- Repository structured step by step
- README included
- Flowchart, word code, test results pushed
- Tutor and lecturer added as collaborators
