# Step 3 & 4: Evaluating Alternatives + Engineering Decision

## Evaluation Criteria

### Simplicity
- **Solution 1 (Sensor-Based)**: Requires installation of multiple sensors and a microcontroller to process signals. Slightly more complex to set up but convenient to maintain.  
- **Solution 2 (Time-Based)**: Easy to implement, requiring only a basic train sensor and timer. However, it lacks flexibility for different conditions.

### Safety
- **Solution 1 (Sensor-Based)**: Safer, as it reacts in real-time to train and vehicle presence. This reduces risks caused by unpredictable factors such as traffic jams, weather, or train speed variations. It also eliminates reliance on manual intervention or fixed timing.  
- **Solution 2 (Time-Based)**: Less safe, since it depends on a preset time delay. If the delay does not match real-world conditions, the gate may raise too early or remain down unnecessarily, leading to potential accidents.

### Reliability
- **Solution 1 (Sensor-Based)**: Highly reliable when installed and maintained correctly. Operates continuously and adapts to different conditions. Failure rates are low but require regular maintenance.  
- **Solution 2 (Time-Based)**: Reliable in simple scenarios, but vulnerable to errors if traffic conditions or train speeds vary. Less adaptable to changing environments.

## Engineering Decision
After evaluating both solutions, the **sensor-based system (Solution 1)** is chosen. Although it is more complex to install, it provides the highest safety and reliability by using real-time detection. This reduces the risk of accidents, ensures smoother gate operation, and increases public trust in the system.
